# This program demonstrates polymorphism in Python.
# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects
# of a common type, while each object can respond to the same method call
# in its own specific way. In this example, we have a list of animals and
# vehicles, and we call the `move()` method on each one. Even though the
# method call is the same, the output is different for each object.
